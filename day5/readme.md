# ðŸ“š Blog Post Layout (HTML Only)

This project is part of our **HTML Basics Class** where we learned how to create a **static blog layout** using only HTML. The goal was to understand the structure of a simple blog post and how to organize content using semantic HTML elements.

## âœ… What We Did in Class

We learned to:

- Use common HTML tags like:
  - `<div>` for grouping sections
  - `<h3>` for the blog author name
  - `<small>` for time information
  - `<p>` for blog post content
  - `<img>` for adding images
  - `<span>` for showing likes and comments
  - `<label>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` for creating a comment form
- Create **two blog posts** with the same structure to practice repetition
- Visually separate posts using the `<hr />` (horizontal line) tag
- Use a free image placeholder service (`https://picsum.photos`) for blog images

## ðŸ’» Whatâ€™s Inside `index.html`

The `index.html` file includes:

Two **static blog posts**  
   Each post contains:
   - Author name (`<h3>`)
   - Time of post (`<small>`)
   - Post content (`<p>`)
   - An image (`<img>`)
   - Like and comment count (`<span>`)
   - A comment input form (`<textarea>` and `<button>`)
